# for maintainability, we can seperate web test cases by page name but I just listed every case in same array

def test_cases(number):
    return testCases[number]


testCases = [
    # [severity, description]
    ['Blocker', 'when user goes to main page, page should be loaded'],
    ['Blocker', 'In Main page, when user search "Депозит" button, he should see result for "Депозит"']
